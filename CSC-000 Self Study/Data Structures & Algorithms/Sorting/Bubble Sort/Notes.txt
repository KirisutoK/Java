What is Bubble Sort?
    Bubble Sort repeatedly compares neighboring elements and swaps them if they're in the wrong order.
    It's called "bubble" because the largest values gradually "bubble up" to the end.

The formula/pattern:
    1. Compare two neighbors
    2. If left > right, swap them
    3. Move to next pair
    4. Repeat until array is sorted

VISUAL EXAMPLE:

ARRAY: [5, 2, 8, 1]

    [5, 2, 8, 1]  → Compare 5 and 2 → 5 > 2? YES → Swap
    [2, 5, 8, 1]  → Compare 5 and 8 → 5 > 8? NO → Don't swap
    [2, 5, 8, 1]  → Compare 8 and 1 → 8 > 1? YES → Swap
    [2, 5, 1, 8]  → 8 is now in correct position!

FORMULA:
    OUTER LOOPS: n-1 (n = length of array)
    INNER LOOPS: n-i-1 (i = index of current element) (n = length of array)

EXAMPLE CODE:
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length - 1; i++) {                        // OUTER LOOPS
        for (int j = 0; j < array.length - i - 1; j++)                  // INNER LOOPS
    }
