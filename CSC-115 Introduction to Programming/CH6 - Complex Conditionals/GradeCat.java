// =============== LAB SUMMARY ===============

/*
 * 1. What was the hardest part of this lab?
 *  Figuring out how to make a condition where the program has to identify and compare the numbers (><=).
 *  It was hard since switch does not work the same as if statements, rather they work by a single
 *  integer values. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 2. What will you always remember (never forget) from this exercise?
 *  I will never forget that math equations can make the program shorter. It maybe very hard to read
 *  when you are editing it but if you do the calculation. it totaly make sense, i also had an error 
 *  where my variable LETTER did not work and with the help of ChatGPT to analayze whats the problem
 *  of my code, i efficiently solved it. (I needed to put a default on the switch statement)
