// TODO: Requirements:
// TODO:
// TODO: Must have a minimum of 3 packages each with a clear and logical purpose
// TODO: Must demonstrate all 4 access modifiers (public, protected, package-private, private) — each used meaningfully, not just randomly placed
// TODO: Must have at least one package-private class that is hidden from outside packages but used internally by a public class in the same package (the gateway pattern)
// TODO: Must have at least one protected attribute or method that is accessed by a subclass in a different package through inheritance
// TODO: Must have proper import statements wherever classes cross package boundaries
// TODO: Must have a fully working Main.java that demonstrates the system end-to-end
// TODO: Must have at least 6 classes total across all packages
// TODO: The system must make real-world logical sense — classes and their relationships should feel natural


// MY MISTAKES:
// SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT DATABASE ONLY HAS DATAS
// SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT IF THERE IS A DATABASE, IT SHOULD BE PACKAGE-PRIVATE OR PRIVATE AND LET ANOTHER CLASS (DATABASEMANAGEMENT) TO HANDLE ALL THE ADDING/REMOVING/CHANGING OF THE DATAS TO MAKE IT EXTRA SECURE
//
// TAKEAWAY:
// it was a good project for 2 days. it definetely had learning alot with this lesson and i did not regret anything to what i said to professor claude about my complaints about the last activity.
// I am very happy and satisfied with all of this activities so far and i would like to do more.
//
 // Thank you, Professor Claude!
