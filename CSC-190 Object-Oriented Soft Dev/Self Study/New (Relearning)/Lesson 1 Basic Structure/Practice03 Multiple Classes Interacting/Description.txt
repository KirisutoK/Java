Challenge #3: Multiple Classes Interacting
    This one tests if you can make classes work together, which is crucial for OOP.
    Create a Library System with two classes:

Class 1: Book

→ Private attributes: 
    • title (String), 
    • author (String), 
    • isbn (String), 
    • isAvailable (boolean)
→ Constructor that takes title, author, and isbn (set isAvailable to true by default)
→ Getters for all attributes
→ Method borrowBook() - sets isAvailable to false and prints a message
→ Method returnBook() - sets isAvailable to true and prints a message
→ Method to display book info

Class 2: Member
→ Private attributes: 
    • memberName (String), 
    • memberId (int), 
    • borrowedBook (Book) - this holds a Book object!
→ Constructor that takes memberName and memberId
→ Getters for all attributes
→ Method borrowBook(Book book) - takes a Book parameter, checks if it's available, if yes: borrows it and stores it in borrowedBook, if no: prints "Book not available"
→ Method returnBook() - returns the borrowed book (if they have one) and sets borrowedBook to null
→ Method to display member info including borrowed book details

In Main:
    • Create 3 books
    • Create 2 members
    • Have member 1 borrow a book
    • Have member 2 try to borrow the same book (should fail)
    • Have member 1 return the book
    • Have member 2 borrow it successfully now
    • Display all information


===========================================
    What I'm testing:

    Classes referencing other classes
    Object composition (Member "has-a" Book)
    Methods that take objects as parameters
    Logic and state management

    This is more complex - take your time!
