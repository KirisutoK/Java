Polymorphism allows objects to take many forms and behave differently based on their actual type
(Think: A remote control that works with different devices - same buttons, different results)

What is Polymorphism?

- Polymorphism means "many forms" - one interface, multiple implementations
    → A parent class reference can hold different child objects
    → Each child object behaves according to its own type, not the parent
    → The correct method is called at runtime based on the actual object type
    → Use parent types to write flexible, reusable code

Key terminology:
    • Upcasting: Storing a child object in a parent reference (Animal a = new Dog();)
    • Dynamic method dispatch: JVM automatically calls the correct overridden method at runtime
    • Compile-time type: The declared type (what the variable says it is)
    • Runtime type: The actual object type (what it really is)

Common uses:
→ Writing flexible code that works with multiple types (one method handles all Animals)
→ Collections of mixed objects (ArrayList<Animal> can hold Dogs, Cats, Birds)
→ Method parameters accepting any subclass (processAnimal(Animal a) works with any animal)
→ Reducing code duplication (one loop processes different object types differently)

Important Syntax that I have learned:

    Parent ref = new Child();     → Upcasting (store child in parent reference)
    animal.makeSound();           → Calls overridden method from actual object type
    instanceof                    → Checks actual object type before casting
    (Child) parentRef             → Downcasting (convert parent reference back to child)
    @Override                     → Marks method as polymorphic (overriding parent)

Key rules:
- Parent reference can only call methods defined in the parent class (even if child has more)
- The actual method executed is determined by the object's real type, not the reference type
- Overridden methods are called polymorphically, but new child methods are not accessible without casting
- Use instanceof before downcasting to avoid ClassCastException
- Polymorphism only works with overridden methods (not with fields or static methods)
- Parent reference = flexibility, Child reference = access to all child methods

Examples of polymorphism:
    Animal animal = new Dog();     // Dog stored as Animal
    animal.makeSound();            // Calls Dog's makeSound(), not Animal's
    // animal.fetch();             // ERROR! fetch() not in Animal class
    
    if (animal instanceof Dog) {   // Check before casting
        Dog dog = (Dog) animal;    // Downcast to access Dog methods
        dog.fetch();               // Now works!
    }
