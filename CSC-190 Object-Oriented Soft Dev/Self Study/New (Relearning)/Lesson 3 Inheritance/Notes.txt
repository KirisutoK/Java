Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class
(Think: A child inheriting traits from a parent)

What is Inheritance?

• Inheritance creates a parent-child relationship between classes
    → The child class (subclass) gets all non-private members from the parent class (superclass)
    → The child can add its own unique features on top
    → Use the "extends" keyword to inherit

Key terminology:
    • Superclass (Parent class): The class being inherited from
    • Subclass (Child class): The class that inherits
    • "extends": The keyword that creates the inheritance relationship

Common uses:
→ Code reusability (write common code once in parent, use in all children)
→ Creating hierarchies (Animal → Dog, Cat, Bird)
→ Specialization (BankAccount → SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount)
→ Polymorphism (treating different objects through a common parent type)

Important Syntax that I have learned:

    extends             → Creates inheritance relationship (class Dog extends Animal)
    super()             → Calls the parent class constructor (must be first line in child constructor)
    super.methodName()  → Calls a parent class method from the child
    @Override           → Indicates you're replacing a parent method with a new version
    protected           → Access modifier that allows child classes to access parent members
    instanceof          → Checks if an object is an instance of a class (dog instanceof Animal)

Key rules:
- Java only allows single inheritance (one parent class, but a parent can have many children)
- Constructors are NOT inherited (but you can call them with super())
- Private members are inherited but NOT directly accessible in the child
- A subclass can override parent methods to change behavior
- Use super() to call parent constructor, must be FIRST line in child constructor
