New Stuff that i have learned:

Super Constructor
    It's a parent constructor where you always have to use it to its children

    Ex.
    Parent Constructor is:
        Parent(int Age, String Name, String Color)

    Children Constructor should be:
        Children(int Age, String Name, String Color)
            super(Age, Name, Color)

        Or

        Children()
                    super(18, "Christ", "Blue")
