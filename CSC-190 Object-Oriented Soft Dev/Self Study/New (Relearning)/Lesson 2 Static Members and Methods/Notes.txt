Static are commonly used for tracking (Variables are shared across)

What is static?

• static members (variables and methods) belong to the class itself, not to individual objects
    → They're shared across all instances of the class
    → You can access them without creating an object using ClassName.staticMember

Key differences:
    • Instance variables: Each object has its own copy (e.g., each Student has their own name)
    • Static variables: One copy shared by all objects (e.g., a counter for total students created)

Common uses:
• Utility methods (like Math.sqrt(), Math.random())
• Constants (like Math.PI)
• Counters (tracking how many objects were created)
• Shared data across all instances
