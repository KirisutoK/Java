Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features.
(Think: A blueprint - defines what to build, not how to build it)

What is Abstraction?
- Creates templates that subclasses must follow
    → Abstract classes cannot be instantiated (can't create objects directly)
    → Forces subclasses to implement certain methods
    → Can have both complete methods and incomplete methods

Key terminology:
    • Abstract class: A template class that cannot be instantiated
    • Abstract method: A method without a body (just declaration)
    • Concrete method: A regular method with a body (has implementation)

Common uses:
→ Creating templates (Shape → Circle, Rectangle)
→ Enforcing rules ("All vehicles MUST have a start() method")
→ Sharing common code while forcing specific implementations

Important Syntax:
    javaabstract class ClassName                    → Declares abstract class
    public abstract void methodName();              → Abstract method (no body, ends with ;)
    class Child extends AbstractClass               → Must implement all abstract methods


Key rules:

Cannot create objects from abstract classes: Animal a = new Animal(); ❌
Can use as reference: Animal a = new Dog(); ✅
Subclasses MUST implement all abstract methods
Abstract classes CAN have constructors, fields, and regular methods
Abstract methods have NO body (just semicolon, no { })
