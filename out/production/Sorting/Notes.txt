What is Selection Sort?
    Selection Sort repeatedly finds the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array and moves it to the beginning.

The pattern/process:
    1. Find the minimum element in the unsorted portion
    2. Swap it with the first element of the unsorted portion
    3. Move the boundary between sorted and unsorted
    4. Repeat until the entire array is sorted

Think of it like: Picking the smallest card from your hand repeatedly and placing it in order.

VISUAL EXAMPLE:

ARRAY: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]

    INITIAL:
        [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]
         ↑ start here

    PASS 1: Find minimum in the array (1)
        [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]  → Find min = 1 (at index 3)
         ↑       ↑
        Swap 5 and 1

        [1, 2, 8, 5, 9]  → 1 is now in correct position
         ✓ sorted | unsorted

    PASS 2: Find minimum in remaining array (2)
        [1, 2, 8, 5, 9]  → Find min = 2 (at index 1)
            ↑
        Already in correct position, no swap needed

        [1, 2, 8, 5, 9]  → 2 is now in correct position
         ✓  ✓ sorted | unsorted

    PASS 3: Find minimum in remaining array (5)
        [1, 2, 8, 5, 9]  → Find min = 5 (at index 3)
               ↑    ↑
        Swap 8 and 5

        [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]  → 5 is now in correct position
         ✓  ✓  ✓ sorted | unsorted

    PASS 4: Find minimum in remaining array (8)
        [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]  → Find min = 8 (at index 3)
                  ↑
        Already in correct position, no swap needed

        [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]  → 8 is now in correct position
         ✓  ✓  ✓  ✓ sorted | unsorted

    PASS 5: Only one element left, automatically sorted
        [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]  → Done! ✅
         ✓  ✓  ✓  ✓  ✓ all sorted

FORMULA:
    OUTER LOOPS:
        Starting -> 0
        Comparing -> n-1 (n = length of array)
    INNER LOOPS:
        Starting -> i + 1 (i = outer loops)
        Comparing -> n

    THE SWAP FUNCTION:
        int temp = arr[minIndex];
        arr[minIndex] = arr[i];
        arr[i] = temp;

    Variables that needed to be stored:
     m = minimumIndex (index of the lowest value)
     t = temporary variable of the minimum value

EXAMPLE CODE:
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {                               // OUTER LOOP
        int minIndex = i;                                                    // saving the index of the minimum value
        for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {                           // INNER LOOP
            if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {                                    // updates the minimum index if smaller value is found
                minIndex = j;
                }
            }

        int MinimumValue = arr[minIndex];                                        // swapping the values
        arr[minIndex] = arr[i];
        arr[i] = MinimumValue;
        }
