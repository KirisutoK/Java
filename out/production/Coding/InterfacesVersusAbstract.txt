Interfaces define a contract of methods that a class must implement, without specifying how.
(Think: A contract - "You must provide these methods")

What is an Interface?
    → A pure contract that defines WHAT a class must do, not HOW
    → All methods are abstract by default (no body)
    → A class can implement multiple interfaces
    → Cannot be instantiated (can't create objects)
    → No Constructor

Key Terminology:
    • Interface: A contract defining method signatures
    • implements: Keyword to adopt an interface
    • Multiple interfaces: A class can implement many at once

Important Syntax:
    • interface InterfaceName              → Declares an interface
    • void methodName();                   → Abstract method (no body)
    • class Name implements Interface      → Class adopts interface
    • class Name implements A, B, C        → Multiple interfaces
    • default void method() { }            → Method with body (Java 8+)

Interface vs Abstract Class:
    • Abstract Class:
        -> Can have both abstract and concrete methods
        -> Can have constructors
        -> Can have instance variables
        -> A class extends ONE abstract class

    • Interface:
        -> Only abstract methods (and default/static methods in Java 8+)
        -> No constructors
        -> Only constants
        -> A class implements MULTIPLE interfaces ✓
