Challenge #5b: Complex 3-Class Interaction (School Management System)
This is the most complex challenge yet. You'll have 3 classes working together with multiple relationships.
Create a School Management System:

Class 1: Course
    • Private attributes: courseName (String), courseCode (String), instructor (String), maxStudents (int), enrolledCount (int)
    • Constructor takes courseName, courseCode, instructor, and maxStudents (set enrolledCount to 0)
    • Getters for all attributes
    • Method enrollStudent() - increases enrolledCount by 1 if course isn't full, returns true if successful, false if full
    • Method dropStudent() - decreases enrolledCount by 1 if there are enrolled students, returns true if successful, false if no students enrolled
    • Method isFull() - returns true if enrolledCount >= maxStudents
    • Method to display course info including how many spots are left


Class 2: Student
 • Private attributes: studentName (String), studentId (int), enrolledCourses (Course array with size 5 - max 5 courses per student), courseCount (int - tracks how many courses enrolled)
 • Constructor takes studentName and studentId (initialize the array, set courseCount to 0)
 • Getters for studentName, studentId, and courseCount
 • Method enrollInCourse(Course course) - attempts to enroll in a course. Check if:
    → Student isn't already at max courses (5)
    → Course isn't full
    → Student isn't already enrolled in this course (check the array)
    → If all checks pass: add course to array, increment courseCount, call course.enrollStudent(), print success message
    → If any check fails: print appropriate error message
 • Method dropCourse(Course course) - finds the course in the array, removes it, shifts remaining courses left in array, decrements courseCount, calls course.dropStudent()
 • Method to display student info including all enrolled courses


Class 3: School
    • Private attributes: schoolName (String), students (Student array with size 10), studentCount (int), courses (Course array with size 5), courseCount (int)
    • Constructor takes schoolName (initialize arrays, set counts to 0)
    • Method addStudent(Student student) - adds student to array if space available
    • Method addCourse(Course course) - adds course to array if space available
    • Method findStudent(int studentId) - searches student array and returns the Student object (or null if not found)
    • Method findCourse(String courseCode) - searches course array and returns the Course object (or null if not found)
    • Method displayAllStudents() - displays info for all students
    • Method displayAllCourses() - displays info for all courses


In Main:
    • Create a School
    • Create 3 courses with different max student limits (e.g., 2, 3, 2)
    • Add courses to the school
    • Create 4 students
    • Add students to the school
    • Have students enroll in various courses:
        → Student 1 enrolls in Course 1 and Course 2
        → Student 2 enrolls in Course 1 and Course 2
        → Student 3 tries to enroll in Course 1 (should fail - course full)
        → Student 3 enrolls in Course 3
        → Student 1 tries to enroll in Course 3
    • Student 1 drops Course 2
    • Student 4 enrolls in Course 2 (should succeed now)

    • Display all students and their enrolled courses
    • Display all courses and their enrollment numbers


What I'm testing:
Managing arrays of objects within objects (School has Students, Students have Courses)
Complex validation logic across multiple classes
Methods that interact with methods in other classes
Searching through arrays
Array manipulation (removing items, shifting elements)
Return values to indicate success/failure

This is challenging! Take your time and work through it step by step. Don't hesitate to test as you go.
